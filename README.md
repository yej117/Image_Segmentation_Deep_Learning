# Image Segmentation Deep Learning 

This respository is used as the final project for the course "Deep Learning" on [opencampus](https://edu.opencampus.sh/) in the Winter semester 2020/21.

The aim of this project is to finish the task of image segmentation.
The cloud segmentation challenge on Kaggle is one of our interests.
